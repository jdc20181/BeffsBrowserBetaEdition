# BeffsBrowserBetaEdition

BeffsBrowser Beta Edition is a testing platform for some changes in [BeffsBrowser](https://github.com/jdc20181/BeffsBrowser)


What it features is less than what the current and most stable version has to offer. Unlike in the past, this will stick around and continue to build up to the current version offered but with more features instead of less. 

Because this is an entire stand alone application, it is going to take some time to develop. 

**Currently in Development**
